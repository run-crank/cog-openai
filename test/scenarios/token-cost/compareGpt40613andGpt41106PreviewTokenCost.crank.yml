scenario: Compare completion token cost of models Gpt 40613 and Gpt 41106 Preview with a vague prompt
description: Asks a vague question to Gpt 40613 and Gpt 41106 Preview and checks which model returns a completion token cost of less than 250 tokens (expecation based on ChatGPT 3.5)

tokens:
  test:
    trivialPrompt: give me the summary of the bee movie
    operator: be less than
    expectation: 250
    tokenTypeA: completion
    modelA: gpt-4-0613
    modelB: gpt-4-1106-preview
steps:
- step: OpenAI model {{test.modelA}} {{test.tokenTypeA}} token cost in response to "{{test.trivialPrompt}}" should {{test.operator}} {{test.expectation}} tokens
  data:
    __stepOrder: 1
- step: OpenAI model {{test.modelB}} {{test.tokenTypeA}} token cost in response to "{{test.trivialPrompt}}" should {{test.operator}} {{test.expectation}} tokens
  data:
    __stepOrder: 2
