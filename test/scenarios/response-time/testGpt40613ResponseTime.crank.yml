scenario: Test response time of Gpt 40613 model with a trivial prompt
description: Asks a simple question to Gpt 40613 and checks if the response time is less than 1 second

tokens:
  test:
    trivialPrompt: what is 1 plus 1
    operator: be less than
    responseTime: 1000
    modela: gpt-4-0613
steps:
- step: OpenAI model {{test.modela}} response time in response to "{{test.trivialPrompt}}" should {{test.operator}} {{test.responseTime}} ms
